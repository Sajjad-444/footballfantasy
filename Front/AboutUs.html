          <p>
            Fantasy football is a game that casts you in the role of a Fantasy
            Manager, given the task to pick a squad of real-life players who
            score points for your team based on their real-life performances
            in their matches.
          </p>
          <div class="image"><img src="Images/lineup.png" /></div>
          <p>
            To play Fantasy Football you’ll need to pick a team of 11 or
            sometimes a squad of 15 real-life players or more,that will
            represent you each week of the season. Over each of those weeks
            they will score you points which will add and subtract to a total
            that will be compared to other teams in your mini league and/or in
            the Fantasy Game world overall with prizes at stake.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="flexbox-item flexbox-item-2">
          <h2 class="heading">How do I pick my team or Squad?</h2>
          <div class="image"><img src="Images/logo.jpg" /></div>
          <p>
            Every Fantasy Football game will hand you a budget which you spend
            on your team or squad. If you new to Fantasy Football, this budget
            may well seem generous but once you take a look at the player list
            and start selecting, it’s a good bet that it will start getting
            eaten up pretty quickly.

          </div>
          <p>
            In fantasy football, by having a team that you have made, you can play
            with other teams made by others and achieve the experience of a coach
            by leading your team.<br />You can have great players like
            Halaand, Mbappe, Messi, Ronaldo and ... in your team, but having
            great players definitely requires a lot of money. So, to access
            these great players, you have to win the match so that your score
            and budget will increase so that you can have these players in
            your team and your team will become stronger.<br />We hope you win
            all your competitions so that you can score a lot of points and
            achieve bigger goals in the game.<br><br>And finally, we hope you enjoy Football Fantasy.
